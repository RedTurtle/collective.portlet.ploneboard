collective.portlet.ploneboard Installation
=======================

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``collective.portlet.ploneboard`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.portlet.ploneboard

  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
